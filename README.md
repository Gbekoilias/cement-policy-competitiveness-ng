This repository houses an academic research proposal titled:

**"Import Policy Restrictions and Industrial Competitiveness: A Study of the Nigerian Cement Sector."**

## 📘 Project Overview

Over the past two decades, Nigeria has used import restrictions and industrial policy to transform its cement sector from import-dependent to self-sufficient. This project explores whether these protectionist policies have enhanced or hindered the sector’s industrial competitiveness.

The study uses a qualitative research design grounded in secondary data to assess the relationship between policy interventions and market outcomes, such as pricing, capacity utilisation, market structure, and innovation.

## 🎯 Research Aim

To examine how Nigeria’s import policy and foreign exchange restrictions have influenced industrial competitiveness in the cement sector.
